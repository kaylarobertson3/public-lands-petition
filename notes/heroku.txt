Debugging Heroku slipups:

1.) You didn't install dependencies properly (use --save i think)

2.) Package.json:
    -'main' property in package.json. Should be index.js


3.) Package.json:
    -'scripts' sould be 'node index.js'

4.) look here if you have errors:
        -heroku.com: More -- view logs or in terminal with 'heroku logs'

        -more -- run console: run commands you want to run on heroku to text

        -$ heroku run bash - it's like you're in the files. Can ls, ect
